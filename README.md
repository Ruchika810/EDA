# Project Title: EDA on Netflix titles
#Objective
To explore and analyze the Netflix Titles dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques with the goal of uncovering insights into the content distribution, genres, trends over time, and regional diversity. The aim was to understand how Netflixâ€™s content strategy has evolved and what patterns exist in the types of content it offers.

#What I Learned
Strengthened understanding of working with real-world datasets containing missing and inconsistent values.

Learned how to clean and preprocess text-based and date-based features effectively.

Gained hands-on experience in extracting and analyzing date-time information (e.g., release year, date added).

Practiced using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to create compelling and interactive visualizations.

Improved interpretation of categorical and multivariate data to find trends in genre, country, content type, and ratings.

Understood how to generate business or product-related questions from an open dataset.

#What I Achieved
Identified trends such as the increase in original content after 2015 and dominance of movies over TV shows.

Analyzed the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows), top contributing countries, popular genres, and ratings.

Created visuals like bar plots, word clouds, and time-series charts to highlight key findings.

Detected anomalies or patterns like seasonal spikes in content additions or content concentration in a few countries (e.g., US, India).

Prepared the dataset for potential machine learning or recommendation system projects.

Documented the full analysis in a structured and readable format suitable for GitHub or presentation.
